It does not aim to substitute or dispute official police traffic reports. Instead, it aims to complement the existing narrative by providing additional context to the road traffic accident reports disseminated by the media. As such, any interpretation of these findings should be done with this context in mind.This monthly blog therefore seeks to provide patterns of major accidents on highways, given that the majority of such incidents are covered by the media. The process of data extraction can be found in separate blog ['Process of data aquisition and model building'](%22https://euriendd.github.io/AI-for-Public-Good-Blog/posts/data%20aquisition%20process/accident-data-aquisition.html%22).\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Data Completeness\n\nWe only considered variables with \\>70% completeness for quantitative analysis.
