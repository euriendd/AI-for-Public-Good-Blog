It does not aim to substitute or dispute official police traffic reports. Instead, it aims to complement the existing narrative by providing additional context to the road traffic accident reports disseminated by the media. As such, any interpretation of these findings should be done with this context in mind.This monthly blog therefore seeks to provide patterns of major accidents on highways, given that the majority of such incidents are covered by the media\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: package 'RcolorBrewer' is not available for this version of R\n\nA version of this package for your version of R might be available elsewhere,\nsee the ideas at\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Installing-packages\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Perhaps you meant 'RColorBrewer' ?\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: unable to access index for repository http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/RWin/bin/windows/contrib/4.3:\n  cannot open URL 'http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/RWin/bin/windows/contrib/4.3/PACKAGES'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: 'BiocManager' not available.
