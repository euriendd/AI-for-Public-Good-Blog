Instead, it aims to complement the existing narrative by providing additional context to the road traffic accident reports disseminated by the media. As such, any interpretation of these findings should be done with this context in mind.This monthly blog therefore seeks to provide patterns of major accidents on highways, given that the majority of such incidents are covered by the media"
