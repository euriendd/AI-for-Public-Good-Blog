    "text": "In Uganda, road traffic accidents pose a significant challenge, with a high number of fatalities reported on a weekly basis. The Uganda police issues a weekly crime report that includes data on road crashes. However, these reports often lack the necessary details to fully understand the nature and severity of the accidents. This blog aims to use publicly available unstructured data from newspaper articles to get a nuanced picture of what, when, and critical aspects of road accidents to identify hot-spots for targeted actions to enhance road safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{#fig-police report}\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP), a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence, offers an exciting opportunity to extract structured data from text to create a structured database. NLP can be trained to understand human language, enabling the extraction of valuable information from newspaper articles for further analysis. To delve deeper into NLP, you can read more about it in the article Natural Language Processing. In my own exploration of NLP, I utilized its capabilities by training a custom entity recognition model. This model allowed me to extract specific data from newspaper articles, making it easier to analyze and derive insights. To learn more about Named Entity Recognition (NER), which is a fundamental technique in NLP, you can refer to the article Named Entity Recognition."

    "text": "How Named Entity Recognition Works\nNER uses pretrained Large Language Models(LLMs) that are trained on universal entites as shown in the schemer below. However, since LLMs are trained on general corpus of text that may include Wikipedia, it may perform poorly on specific tasks like identifying road traffic variables in a country like Uganda. Becuase of this limitation, I therefore customised the pretrained LLM by training it using a corpus of annotated Ugandan newspaper articles reporting accidents. For more information on LLMs, please refer to LLMs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{#fig-ner process}"
